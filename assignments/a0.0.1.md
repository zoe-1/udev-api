### Let's get started!

First, we need some basic structure: a lib folder, a package.json file, and an initial index.js. 
Since we will be using hapi, we need to include that in the project dependencies.

Second, create a basic hapi server on port 8000 which responds to /version requests and replies with a simple `{ "version": "0.0.1" }` JSON payload. 
The version in the response should come from the package.json file.
